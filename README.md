# AIDriver Challange Solutions
These are worked solutions with notes for each challenge. Teachers can use this code to demonstrate the challenge to the students or present and discuss solutions with the whole class after they have made attempts to solve the challenge.

Notes for how to solve each of the extension challenges are at the bottom and can again be used to give students ideas for how to solve the challenges.

Remember, this is my solution; if students can get it to work using a different solution, then they have produced an acceptable algorithm. There is no right or wrong way.
